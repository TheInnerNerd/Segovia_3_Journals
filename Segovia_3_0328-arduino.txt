	I have noticed the "methods" have similarity like "void" and it has for loops, Arrays are 
	indicated differently and there is a const int. This seems to be differnt from int.  

	Power is required for a circuit, that being ground and positive. Resistors are useful when
	using LEDs

	When we completed 6 projects, starting with the temperture sensor today.

	I plan to create stopwatch of some sort or a something to deal with chance.
