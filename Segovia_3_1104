~A method is like a mini program within a program. The method can be called upon to do what the
method programmed to do.
~I used one method, it was the actual part of the game, it made the game set a random number
and allowed the player to play/ guess a number(s)
~A while loop is like a for loop but through boolean, it will continue to run as long as it is true
~I used the while loop to keep runnong the game, boolean was used to run the while too and boolean
remained true was long as the counter was above 0
