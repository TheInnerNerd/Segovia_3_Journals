The biggest problem solving challenge i had was just getting used to the game. I also faced a challenge
of trial and error because the game requires you to complete specific tasks.
The last problem i solved was i had to multiply a number by 8 was the last i faced. It required me to
of course multiple the inbox number by 8. The most challening part was getting to only use 3 adds.t
This was difficult because the use of jumps.
