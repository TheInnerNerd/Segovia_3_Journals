Given mymap[67][43] Which is the x coordinate? Which is the y coordinate? Why? How does this happen?
    Consider:

            for (int i = 0; i <= map[0].length - 1; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j <= map[1].length - 1; j++) {
                    if (j < map[1].length - 1) {
                      if (i=0){ System.out.print("8888"); #a
                        } else if (map[i][j] != 'x') {
                            System.out.print("."); #e
                        } else {
                            System.out.print(map[i][j]); #b
                        }
                    } else {
                        if (map[i][j] != 'x') {
                            System.out.println("."); #c
                        } else {
                            System.out.println(map[i][j]); #d
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
            
            
          

Write the code from line #a and explain what it does.
	line #a print 8888 in the array at [67][43]
Write the code from line #b and explain what it does.
	it prints the map
Write the code from line #c and explain what it does. Explain how its different than #e
	#e prints what the array is gonna be printed of but #c says if a specific coordinate like
	[2][2] it will print that "."  
Write the code from line #d and explain what it does.
	#d says will if "." is not gonna be something else
Explain how to use a boolean with a while loop. Provide a very specific use case and code example.
	a boolean is the most basic way you can control a while loop
	while (game=true) {
            printArray();
            move();

        }
    } 
	this while loop will continue until game = false whether i impliment it into a death or
	something.
Explain the use of static.
	static makes the variable, or data type accessible throughout the program
Provide an example of how you could use an object with your game. Give a code example.
	You could man a player object first you would have to make the class. Then declare and 
	intialize the object by 
		public static Player player;
	and then 
		player = new Player();
