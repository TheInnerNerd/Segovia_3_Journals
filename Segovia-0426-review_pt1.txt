Write a Java method to return the cubed value of some number.

 public static void cubeIT(int x){
	int a = x*x*x;
	 return int a;
 }

Write an Arduino function to return the cubed value of some number.
 
void loop() {
  int i = 5; 
  int squared; 
  int cubed;
 
  squared = i * i;
  cubed = i * squared;
  
	return cubed;

Create the class, an object, and class constructor for class student

public class Student {
	int hairLength;
	int age;
	string hairColor;
	int grade;
	public Student(int a, int b, string c, int d){
		this.hairLength = a;
		this.age = b;
		this.hairColor = c;
		this.grade = d;

     }
  }
} 

Describe - if we were to continue with Arduino - what would you create?
 
I would continue with my timer, with the help of Colby he somewhat explained what i could do using
java like explainations. I would just assign numbers to a buttob like 1 sec, ten seconds and 60 seconds
I think through that i could finish it all.
