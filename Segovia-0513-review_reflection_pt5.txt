The Slick assignment was intended to gently familiarize you with 2-D arrays. Some students recognized the 2-D arrays from Slick and previous journals --- other students had no recollection.
Which were you? Why? Note - attributing the environment is not pragmatic - as students experienced the same environment (though they might have experienced it differently)
	I was a student that recognized the 2D arrays from slick but i didn't know how
	we used it in slick i just knew it was there and we used it to generate things	
Make a list of ten questions related to the Array assignments pt 1 and 2 - that you predict will be on the semester exam. E.g., object initialization, class constructors, creating and changing arrays, etc.
	1. how could you create a class constructor
	2. what is the difference between array and arraylist	
	3. how do you declare and intialze an object
	4. list datatypes
	5. how do you make an object
	6. what is the main difference between the class and object
	7. why does an Array do y and then x
	8. how is a for loop used when creating an array
	9. how do you print X on an array at 4,5
	10. how do you make a 1D array? 2D? 3D?
