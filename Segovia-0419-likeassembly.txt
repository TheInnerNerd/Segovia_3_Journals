After reading the code examples of assembly and playing the game HRM, there are many similarities.
The jump command, which acts kind of like a for loop, is in aassemby and is known as jmp. Also like
HRM, assembly has a JE which is the assembly equivalent of jump if negative, also both has a 
jump if sero, in assembly it is known as JLE. Both are some what the same form of programming.
