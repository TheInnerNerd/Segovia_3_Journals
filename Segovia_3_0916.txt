~The 3 guiding rules, or principles are:
  -Always tinker, dont be a stopper
  -Helping others helps you
  -No cellphones or other electronics
~We do all this because this will better us as tinker-ers and compter scientist
~The problem solving process, define the problem, generate solutions, decide the course of action,
implement the solution, and evalutate the solution, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE READ DEBUGGING ERROR 
MESSAGES, and from there if it doesn't work try again.
~The underlying motivation is to be a better problem solver
~Perkins reseach, says it's better to be a mover, to problem solver, and not just give up and be a
stopper
