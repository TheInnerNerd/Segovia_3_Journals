We will be revising our Slick game to :
	1. Have multiple levels
	2. Enemies
	3. Traps(or something with coordinates defines by an array.
	4. Give or take damage
	5. Score
	6. Inventory or some compelling alternative
What will you have to do to get this working?
	I will pay atention to suck in all the information I need to successfully get this done. I 
	will also try and fail to do it on my own. I will especially make an effort to get NetBeans
	at home.
Are you prepared?
	I don't think I'm fully prepared just partially maybe.
Do you have all knowledge you need? If not be specific? 
	I have most of the knowledge but putting that knowledge into work i dont know i can do.
