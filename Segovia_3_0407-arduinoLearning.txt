I have learned while working with the Arduino it is very easy to learn in a way. You can pick up 
on the language you are supposed to code in, it is similar to Java and ehat we have primary learned
through out this school year. The book itself has project to teach the potiental of the arduino and
its power.
Another thing I've learned is that tinkering come in handy. You can pick up what you have learned 
through the projects and kind of take bits and pieces of different projects and come up with a 
completely diffent program. It is like arduino is based around tinking and what you can do with it.
The 3rd thing I've learned about CS is how complex yet simple it is. What I mean is how you can do
with such a small thing is literally an infinte of possiblities just like Java and OOP you can do 
anything.
